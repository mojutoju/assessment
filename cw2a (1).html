<h2>Overview and the class hierarchy</h2>

<p>
You are the most junior programmer in a development team, whose task is to
develop some type of role-play game. Your team leader hasn't decided the
details of the game yet, but you are tasked with developing some C++ classes
to model some entities (namely players and objects) and their basic
interactions, as described below.
It is not a full game and most of the actual game logic are not being
implemented here.
</p>
<p>
Your team leader hasn't really played much computer games, so some of 
the requirements below may seem too simplistic or just outright weird.
Also, you may find some design decisions that you are asked to follow to be
rather odd.
It is almost like your team leader wants to test your knowledge on 
inheritance and virtual functions for some reason...
</p>
<p>
A number of different classes are used to model different "objects" and
"players" of the game.
The class hierarchy is as shown in this diagram:
</p>
<pre>
          Object                             Player
            |                                  |
  -------------------------             -----------------
  |       |        |      |             |        |      |
Food    Weapon   Armour   ...         Fighter  Healer  ...
</pre>
<p>
Again, since your team leader has not made up their mind on what exactly
will be in the game, there may be some further types of objects or players
to be added in the future (though not in this assignment).
</p>

<h2>The Object class hierarchy</h2>

<h3>The Object class</h3>

<p>
The <code>Object</code> class represent objects in the game that can be "picked up"
and "used" by players, such as food, weapon, armour etc.
All objects have a name (a string) and a value (a non-negative integer).
Objects are assumed to have unique names.
The meaning of "value" is different depending on what subtype
of object it is.
</p>
<p>
In addition, you probably want each object to "know" who has picked it
up, and therefore it probably should have a pointer that points to the
"owner" of the object. Initially an object does not have any owner,
and it can only be owned by one player (the one who picked it up via the
<code>pickup()</code> function of the <code>Player</code> class).
For technical reason not to be explained here, it would be more convenient
to use a raw pointer (<code>Player*</code>) to record who the owner is, 
rather than a smart pointer. Thus the member variables of the 
<code>Object</code> class may look like this:
<pre>
class Object {
  ... // other member variables
  Player* owner_; // pointer to the Player who picked up this object
};
</pre>
</p>
<p>
The <code>Object</code> class is a base class and should be abstract 
(no object of this class should be instantiated). Nevertheless, it has a 
constructor:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>Object(string name, int value)</code><br/>
Constructor with parameters specifying the name of the object and its value.
The value must not be negative, otherwise the constructor should throw a 
<code>std::invalid_argument</code> exception.
It should also initialise the object to have no owner (for example
by setting the <code>owner_</code> pointer to nullptr).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Furthermore, the <code>Object</code> class (and all its subclasses) should 
support the following functions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>string getName()</code><br/>
Return the name of the object.
</li>
<br/>
<li>
<code>int getValue()</code><br/>
Return the value of the object.
</li>
<br/>
<li>
<code>string print()</code><br/>
Return a string that has the following contents:
<pre>
XXX, name: YYY, value: ZZZ
</pre>
where XXX is the type of the object (so one of Food, Weapon or Armour, so far),
YYY is the name of the object and ZZZ is its value.
Here are three examples:
<pre>
Food, name: apple, value: 5

Weapon, name: sword, value: 20

Armour, name: helmet, value: 10
</pre>
(In this and all other similar functions that return a string to give
a description of an object, you must have the exact whitespaces as shown,
otherwise you will not pass the test cases.
All whitespaces you see here are the single space character (' ').
Please be careful not to include any extra invisible whitespaces.
In the case of multi-line strings, the lines should be separated by
inserting a '\n' character, but there should be no
'\n' after the final line.
All these functions return a string, or write something to the given
output stream; the functions themselves do not print anything to the 
screen directly.)
</li>
<br/>
<li>
<code>void use()</code><br/>
Apply the effect of that object to the player who currently owns them.
The effect depends on what type of object it is, as specified in the
subclasses below.
This should <b>not</b> be a public member function; it should only be 
accessed by the <code>Player</code> class (and its subclasses). See the
<code>use()</code> function in the Player section.
</li>
<br/>
<li>
<code>ostream& operator<<(ostream& os, const Object& o)</code>:<br/>
Overloaded output stream redirection operator, to be implemented 
as a friend function (not a member function) of the <code>Object</code> class.
It prints the content of the given object, as returned by the 
<code>print()</code> function, to the specified output stream.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Food class</h3>

<p>
In addition to those inherited from the parent class, 
all Food objects should support the following operation:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>Food(string name, int value)</code><br/>
Constructor of a food item, specifying its name and value.
</li>
<br/>
<li>
<code>void use()</code><br/>
Using a food object increases the owner's stamina by the value of the
object, but is capped at the maximum stamina of 100.
For example, if a player has stamina 80 and uses a food item of value 10,
the stamina becomes 90. But if the food item has value 25 instead, the
stamina becomes 100 (not 105).
A food item once used is "consumed" and will no longer be in the player's
list of items.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Weapon class</h3>

<p>
In addition to those inherited from the parent class, 
all Weapon objects should support the following functions:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>Weapon(string name, int value)</code><br/>
Constructor of a weapon, specifying its name and value.
</li>
<br/>
<li>
<code>void use()</code>
<p>
Using a weapon means it is listed under the "weapon in use" of its
owner (see the <code>print()</code> function of the <code>Player</code> class),
and it affects the attacking strength of the player
(see the <code>attack()</code> function of the <code>Fighter</code> class).
</p><p>
Only one weapon can be in use at any time. If this
function is called while the player is already using another weapon, 
the old weapon will be "unloaded" and the new weapon takes its place as the
"weapon in use". The old weapon remains in the player's possession 
(and the player may choose to use it again later).
A weapon once in use will remain in use until it is replaced by another
weapon.
<!--For example, ...-->
</p><p>
As you will see in the Fighter section, only fighters can attack, and
therefore really make use of a weapon. Nevertheless,
any player type can use the <code>pickup()</code> and 
<code>use()</code> functions to pick up and indeed "use" weapons,
but if they don't have an <code>attack()</code> 
function it is pointless for them to do so.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Armour class</h3>

<p>
In addition to those inherited from the parent class, 
all Armour objects should support the following functions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>Armour(string name, int value)</code><br/>
Constructor, specifying the name and value of this piece of armour.
</li>
<br/>
<li>
<code>void use()</code>
<p>
Using an armour means it is listed under the "armour in use" of its
owner (see the <code>print()</code> function of the <code>Player</code>
class), and it affects the defending strength of the player
(see the <code>attack()</code> function of the <code>Fighter</code> class).
</p><p>
Unlike weapons, players can use multiple armour items at the same time.
A call to this function will add this armour to the list of
armour "in use" by this player. An armour once used will continue to be
in use forever.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Player class hierarchy</h2>

<h3>The Player class</h3>

<p>
The <code>Player</code> class models a player in the game.
Each player has a health value and a stamina value; both are integers
between 0 and 100. 
They may also carry a number of objects with them, which (as you will see
below) you probably want to represent as a collection of unique pointers.
Each player may, at any one moment, have a "weapon in use" and/or
a number of "armour in use".
</p>
<p>
If a player's health drops to 0, they are dead. Dead players can no longer
take any action and are supposed to be "removed" from the game somehow, 
but once again your team leader hasn't figured out what to do with them yet,
so in the following a player may be dead but still around, and some special 
action needs to be taken about them.
</p>
<p>
The <code>Player</code> class is a base class and should be abstract 
(no object of this class should be instantiated). Nevertheless, 
it has a constructor:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>Player(string name)</code><br/>
Constructor with parameter specifying the name of the player.
It should also initialise its health and stamina to 100, and to have
an empty list of items. It is therefore not using any weapon or armour.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Furthermore, the <code>Player</code> class (and all its subclasses) should 
support the following functions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>string getName()</code><br/>
Return the name of this player.
</li>
<br/>
<li>
<code>int getHealth()</code><br/>
Return the health value of this player.
</li>
<br/>
<li>
<code>int getStamina()</code><br/>
Return the stamina value of this player.
</li>
<br/>
<li>
<code>void pickup(unique_ptr&lt;Object&gt; p)</code>
<p>
Add the object pointed to by the specified unique pointer to the list of
items of this player. The object is represented by a unique pointer with the
intention being that once it is picked up by one player, it cannot be 
picked up by another player. As a result, it is to be passed into this
function with the <code>std::move()</code> function like this:
</p>
<pre>
unique_ptr&lt;Food&gt; apple = make_unique&lt;Food&gt;("apple", 5);
Fighter alice("alice");
alice.pickup(std::move(apple));
</pre>
<p>
and you probably would want to use the same mechanism to "move" the
incoming pointer to some data structure that stores all pointers to objects
this player currently has.
</p><p>
If the player is already dead, throw a <code>std::logic_error</code>
exception and do not do any of the above.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<code>bool use(string name)</code>
<p>
"Use" the item with the specified name. Depending on what type of item it
is, its effect of being used is different. Essentially you should call 
the <code>use()</code> function of that object and let it do its job.
</p><p>
If the player is already dead, throw a <code>std::logic_error</code>
exception and do not do anything.
If the player does not currently possess an item of that name, return false
(and do nothing else).
Otherwise (the item is successfully used), return true.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<code>string getInventory()</code>
<p>
Return a string listing all the items
the player currently possesses, in precisely the following format:
</p>
<pre>
List of items:
 Food, name: xxx, value: xx
 Weapon, name: xxx, value: xx
 ...
</pre>
<p>
where each line prints the details of an object exactly as in the
<code>print()</code> function of the <code>Object</code> class, but with
one extra space character in front.
</p><p>
The items must be listed in the order they were picked up.
</p><p>
If there are no items, the one-line string 
"<code>List of items: none</code>" should be returned instead.
</p><p>
Any weapon/armour that are added as "in use" by the <code>use()</code>
function continue to appear under this list of items. Likewise any weapon
"unloaded" (replaced by another weapon as "in use")
is also listed here.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<code>string print()</code><br/>
Return a string that prints all information about the player, in exactly
the following format:
<pre>
Name: xxx
Type: xxx
Health: xx
Stamina: xx
List of items:
 xxx, name: xxx, value: xx
 xxx, name: xxx, value: xx
Weapon in use: xxx
Armour in use: xxx, xxx
</pre>
<p>
It should be clear what most of this means. The type is either Fighter or
Healer. The "List of items" is exactly the output produced by 
<code>getInventory()</code>. The weapon/armour in use states the names of
the weapon/armour. If no weapon/armour is in use, it should say
"none" in place of the xxx. Multiple armours in use should be listed in the 
order they were first "used".
</p><p>
The line "weapon in use" should not appear for healers, since they cannot
attack, even though theoretically they can pickup and "use" weapons.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<code>ostream& operator<<(ostream& os, const Player& p)</code><br/>
Overloaded output stream redirection operator, to be implemented as a
friend function (not a member function) of the <code>Player</code> class. 
It prints the contents of the given player, as returned by the 
<code>print()</code> function, to the specified output stream.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Fighter class</h3>

<p>
Fighter is a subclass of Player.
In addition to those inherited from the parent class,
the <code>Fighter</code> class should support the following operations:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>Fighter(string name)</code><br/>
Constructor, specifying the name of the fighter.
</li>
<br/>
<li>
<code>bool attack(Player& other)</code><br/>
Attack the player specified in the parameter. Only fighters can attack
others, but anyone can be attacked.
When player A attacks player B, the following should happen:
<ol>
<li>
If A or B is already dead, it should throw a <code>std::logic_error</code>
exception, and skip all the following.
Note that the exception is thrown only if A or B is already dead
<i>before</i> the attack, not as a result of the attack.
<br/>
In particular, if B is the one who is already dead, the exception object
must be constructed with the following string as the argument:
<code>"Stop! xxx is already dead."</code>
where xxx is the name of B.
(In other words, this string is what should be returned when the
<code>what()</code> function of the exception object is called.)
</li>
<li>
If A's stamina is less than 10, skip all the following and return false.
</li>
<li>Reduce A's stamina by 10.</li>
<li>Define the <i>attacking strength</i> of A to be 10 plus the value of A's
weapon in use (if no weapon is in use then the attacking strength is just 10),
and the <i>defending strength</i> of B to be the total value of all B's armour
in use (if no armour is in use then the defending strength is 0).
If the attacking strength is greater than the defending strength,
reduce B's health by the difference in these two values. If B's health
becomes 0 (or less) as a result of this, then B is dead. 
Otherwise (if defending strength is greater) nothing happens to B.
<br/>
For example, if A is using a weapon of value 30,
and B has health 10 and is using an armour of value 35, then B's health
after the attack is reduced to 5.
</li>
<li>
If the attack reduced the opponent's health, return true, otherwise 
(because A does not have enough stamina or B's defending strength is
high enough) return false.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Healer class</h3>

<p>
Healer is a special kind of Player. They cannot attack, but they can 
heal (increase the health) of other players.

In addition to those inherited from the parent class, 
the <code>Healer</code> class should support the following operations:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>Healer(string name)</code><br/>
Constructor, specifying the name of the healer.
</li>
<br/>
<li>
<code>bool heal(Player& other)</code><br/>
Increase the health of the specified player
<!--(which can be the healer itself)-->
as follows.
When player A tries to heal player B, the following should happen:
<ol>
<li>
If A or B is already dead, it should throw a <code>std::logic_error</code>
exception, and skip all the following.
</li>
<li>
If A's stamina is less than 10, skip all the following and return false.
</li>
<li>Reduce A's stamina by 10.</li>
<li>Increase B's health by 20, but not exceeding 100.
For example if B's health was 95 before the heal, its health only goes
up to 100, not 115.
</li>
<li>
If the healing increased B's health, return true, otherwise
(because A does not have enough stamina or B's health is already 100)
return false.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>

<!--
Destructor, copy constructor and copy assignment operator are assumed to
be not required (i.e. the default is adequate). If for some reason 
they are not adequate for your implementation then you should supply them. 
-->

<h2>What else needs to change and what cannot be changed</h2>

<p>
All the classes have no member variables at the moment
(except the <code>owner_</code> variable in the <code>Object</code> class);
you will need to decide what protected/private (but not public)
data members to add to the classes. 
There are multiple ways to represent the objects and their properties, 
and there is not necessarily a "best" way.
<!--For example, a rectangle may be represented by the coordinates of its
four corners, or in fact only two opposite corners are enough;
or the coordinates of its centre plus its height and width; or
many other ways.-->
You will also need some data structure (preferably from STL) to store the 
collection of Objects (or unique pointers to Objects) that a Player has.
</p>
<p>
All the classes and their inheritance relationships have been defined for
you in the Game.h file. 
However, all the required member functions are only declared in the highest 
class in the class hierarchy where they are relevant. 
You will need to decide whether some subclasses should override some of 
the functions, where in the hierarchy should they be implemented, and 
whether each function should be made virtual.
In addition, all top-level classes should be abstract; no instances of 
<code>Object</code> or <code>Player</code> should be allowed to be created. 
This means each top-level class must have some pure virtual member functions. 
</p>
<p>
Therefore, you will need to decide whether each function should have the 
<code>virtual</code>, <code>override</code>, <code>final</code> keywords 
and/or the <code>= 0</code> pure specifier.
You may need to duplicate some function declarations and/or their 
implementations (bodies) to some subclasses, or move them to some other 
classes (even when the comments say IMPLEMENT ME).
Please see further notes in the marking criteria about this.
</p>
<p>
You must not change the existing public interface of the classes, other than 
in relation to inheritance, virtual-ness and pure-ness as explained above. 
You are allowed to add other public/protected/private member functions, 
should you want to.
You are also allowed to add frienships between classes.
</p>
<p>
Do NOT move or remove existing code given to you, except those parts
labelled as dummy code or in relation to inheritance/virtualness/pureness
as above.
In particular you must not change the test suite.
If you somehow believe you "need" to move or remove
something (in order for the program to compile, for example),
you almost certainly did something
wrong and it would not compile when I test it. Past examples include
removing header guards, moving constants defined in .h out to .cpp,
removing function definitions in .h that you decide to not attempt, etc.
</p>

<h2>Files Provided</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="Game.h">Game.h</a></li>
<li><a href="Game.cpp">Game.cpp</a></li>
</ul>
These are the only two files you need to modify/submit. All code written
by you should be in there.
<ul>
<li><a href="main.cpp">main.cpp</a></li>
</ul>
This is a simple game that illustrates how the 
functions can be called.
<ul>
<li><a href="GameTester.h">GameTester.h</a></li>
<li><a href="GameTester.cpp">GameTester.cpp</a></li>
<li><a href="GameTesterMain.cpp">GameTesterMain.cpp</a></li>
</ul>
They are used for the execution testing part (see the next section).
<ul>
<li><a href="makefile">makefile</a></li>
</ul>
This is a makefile that will compile the main executable and the testing
suite executable.

<h2>Marking Criteria and Test Suite</h2>

<p>
See <a href="ms.html">this separate page</a> for the marking criteria.
</p>
<p>
To use the test suite (which is used in the execution testing part of the 
marking), simply type "make" in a linux terminal (with all 
the above files in the same folder). It will (assuming you did not break
Game.h or Game.cpp) produce a GameTesterMain executable file. Run the 
program by typing
<pre>
./GameTesterMain a
</pre>
or
<pre>
./GameTesterMain a b c d
</pre>
which runs a single test case or multiple test cases respectively. 
We will also demonstrate its use in class. 
</p>
<p>
The given Game.h and Game.cpp files (without your contributions)
are already compilable with the test suite. 
It might even pass a few test cases. So, whatever you do, please don't 
break them...
</p>
<p>
The test suite may not cover all corner cases, so passing all test
cases does not guarantee your program is 100% correct.
Also, unfortunately we cannot isolate the testing of the various functions.
For example to pass those test cases meant for <code>use()</code> you 
need to also implement <code>pickup()</code> at least partially correctly.
</p>

<h2>Submission Instructions</h2>

<p>
Submit your completed work on Blackboard ("Assessment and Feedback" on the 
left, then "Assignment 2A").
</p>
<p>
<b>Submit only the files Game.h and Game.cpp.</b>
Just upload them as two separate files with those exact names. 
DO NOT change their names including 
upper/lowercase, DO NOT change the extension to .txt or .cpp.txt or some 
such, DO NOT put them in a Word or pdf file (yes, someone actually did 
that), DO NOT put them in a zip archive, and DO NOT upload the entire 
project folder of whatever IDE you are using. Any such problems will incur 
a penalty. 
</p>
<p>
While you may want to change the main.cpp file for your own testing, 
it is not part of the submission. The test suites and the makefiles also
should not be submitted. If you submit them, they will be ignored and I
will use my own version for testing.
</p>
<p>
This is an <b>individual assignment</b>, and collaboration is not permitted.
Plagiarism will be treated strictly according to standard university and
departmental procedures.
Your submissions will be sent to a plagiarism detection service
(<a href="https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/">MOSS</a>).
</p>
<p>
In line with university policy, marking will be done anonymously. Only 
the Blackboard-supplied userid / student number will be visible in marking. 
</p>
<p>
For the above two reasons, do not include your name, userid, student number,
or any other personally identifible information in your programs.
